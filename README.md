3. The first player to connect four discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If the board is full and no player has connected four, the game ends in a draw.

2. Players take turns clicking on an empty cell to place their mark (X or O).
3. The first player to place three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
